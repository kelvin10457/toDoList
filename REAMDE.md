# 📝 Task Manager — JS + Tailwind Practice

This project is a **simple task manager** built using **vanilla JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows you to **create, edit, update, and delete tasks** through a clean and minimal interface that uses modals for user interactions.

## 🎯 Motivation

I built this project to **reaffirm my foundational JavaScript skills** — focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and modular code structure — while also **learning Tailwind CSS** to make the design process faster but more challenging at the same time.

I’m currently reinforcing my front-end fundamentals because I want to **learn React** and eventually **master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
This project is part of that journey — I plan to build a few more JavaScript-based projects like this one before **migrating them to React** to better understand component-based architecture and state management.

## ⚙️ Features

- ➕ **Create** new tasks with title, description, and status.  
- ✏️ **Edit** tasks dynamically using a modal window.  
- ❌ **Delete** tasks directly from the modal.  
- 🎨 **Styled with Tailwind CSS**, emphasizing responsiveness and clarity.  
- 💾 Tasks are handled in-memory using a JavaScript array (no backend).

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — core logic and DOM manipulation  
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling and layout  
- **HTML5** — structure

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Add, edit, and delete tasks directly in the interface.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Managing state (tasks) using plain JavaScript objects and arrays.  
- Dynamically updating the DOM with event listeners and template strings.  
- Handling modals for user interactions.  
- Using Tailwind CSS utilities for clean, modern layouts without writing custom CSS.  
- Structuring small projects to make future migration to React easier.

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Persist tasks using `localStorage`.  
- Add task filtering by status.  
- Improve accessibility and animations with Tailwind.  
- Convert this logic into a **React app** as part of my MERN stack learning path.
